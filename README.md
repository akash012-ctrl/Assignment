## Navbar component

The Navbar component is a navbar with two items: "Brand" and "GetUsers". When the "GetUsers" item is clicked, the component makes an API call to retrieve a list of users and displays them using the ShowUsers component. The component also includes a loading indicator, which is displayed while the component is in the process of making the API call and retrieving the user data. If the component has not yet made the API call or if the call was unsuccessful and no user data is available, a message is displayed to the user to click on "GetUsers" to retrieve the data.

## ShowUsers Component

The ShowUsers component is a component for displaying a list of users. It receives a list of users as a prop and displays each user in a card, with the user's avatar, name, and email address.

## Loader Component

The Loader component is a component for displaying a loading indicator. It uses the BeatLoader component from the "react-spinners" library to display a spinner.



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
